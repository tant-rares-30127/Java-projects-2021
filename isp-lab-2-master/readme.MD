# Starting from the template, implement the following exercises:

1) Implement a program according to speciffications bellow:
- Generate a random number n between 2 and 10;
- Populate an array of size n with integers read from the keyboard;
- Compute the arithmetical mean of the array populated in previous step. 

2) Given the Liga 1 ranking. Write a program which ask the user to enter a number of points. If the number match the exact number of points of a team then display the team name.
If the user do not enter an exact number of points then show this message:"No team from Liga 1 have ${numberOfPointsEnteredByUser} points".
<br>The ranking to consider is:<br>
1 CFR Cluj 49 points<br>
2 Universitatea Craiova 46 points<br>
3 FCSB 43 points<br>
4 FC Botosani 42 points<br>
5 Gaz Metan 40 points<br>
6 Astra Giurgiu 39 points<br>

3) Write a program which display the geometric mean of the primes number from [a,b] where a,b->[1,200] a<b, a and b are read from keyboard.
Also display the number of prime numbers which have the sum of digits an even number.

4) Given an vector of N integer elements. Display the first prime/odd/even number from the vector and their respective position

5) Generate a vector of size 20 with random elements from [-1000,1000].
	<br>-display the vector.
	<br>-sort the vector using bubbleSort or quickSort or mergeSort or any sort method
	<br>-display the sorted vector

6) Generate a vector which multiply the precedent 2 values from the vector. First 2 elements of the vector are always 1 and 2. Generate first n elements(n >= 8)
<br> EX: 1, 2, 2, 4, 8, 32, 256, 8192, ...
	<br>a) non-recursively 
	<br>b) recursively

7) Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.
